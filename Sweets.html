<h1>A Short History and Production of Sugar</h1>

<h2> This is an index about Sugar, the main ingredient in sweets </h2>

<p>(If you would like to skip this part of the page, <a href="#Desserts">click here.)</a></p>

<p> It is said that the first people to domesticate and cultivate the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/sugarcane"> sugarcane plant</a> around 8,000 BC were from New Guinea. Soon after, cultivation spread to South Asia where they came up with the process of refining the sugarcane's juice into granulated crystals.</p>
<p> Fast forward to the 18th centrury where the production of sugar was being mechanized, an English Nobleman who went by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Charles_Howard">Edward Charles Howard</a> came up with a method of refining sugar that involved boiling the cane juice not in an open kettle, but in a closed vessel heated by steam and held under partial vacuum. At reduced pressure, water boils at a lower temperature, this development both saved fuel and reduced the amount of sugar lost through <a href="http://www.cooksinfo.com/caramelization"> caramelization.</a></p>

<h2>Molasses</h2>

<p> Molasses is a thick, brown or black, honey-like substance made when cane or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_beet"> beet</a> sugar is processed. <a href="http://thegardenisland.com/news/local/inventor-david-m-weston/article_45f2be74-8a9f-11e1-a87c-0019bb2963f4.html"> David M. Weston</a> invented a centrifugal machine that quickly separated molasses from sugar during the milling process. Molasses is enjoyed as a sweetener in many countries, and most particularly in England where it is called treacle. For hundreds of years, molasses and sulfur, or treacle and brimstone were thought to have healthful benefits, and children were frequently given doses of the product.</p>

<h2>Other Sweeteners</h2>

<p>In the United States and Japan, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-fructose_corn_syrup"> high-fructose corn syrup</a> has replaced sugar in some uses, particularly in soft drinks and processed foods. Sugar substitutes are used instead of sugar for a number of reasons, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Dental care</li>
		<li>To assist in weight loss</li>
		<li>Diabetes and/or Reactive hypoglycemia</li>
		<li>Cost and shelf life</li>
	</ul>

<img src="artsweet.jpg" style="width:350px;height:350px">

<p>Due to health risks of high-fructose corn syrup, the demand for alternative sweeteners is ever increasing. Equal, Splenda and Sweet'n Low are sweeteners often used as substitutes for sugar in beverages like coffee and tea and can even be used in baking. Ingredients found in such sweeteners such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylitol"> xylitol</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"> saccharin</a> have many positive research results that show qualities of dental decay prevention, which causes them to be popular for use in chewing gums and toothpaste.</p>

<h1> <a name="Cake"></a> Cake</h1>

<p>Cake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. Cake has a long and rich history. The word itself is from Viking Origin from the Old Norse word "Kaka". In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
Typical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves,nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.

<h2> Cake Mixes</h2>

<p>During the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States. One company patented a cake-bread mix in order to deal with this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, cake as it is known today became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.
Later, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that the cake in a box rendered the cake-making function of housewives relatively dispiriting. This was a time when women, retired from the war-time labor force, and in a critical ideological period in American history, were confined to the domestic sphere and oriented towards the freshly blossoming consumerism in the US. In order to compensate for this situation, the marketing psychologist Ernest Dichter ushered in the solution to the cake mix problem: frosting. Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.
Ever since, cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets, and is complemented with frosting in a can.</p>
